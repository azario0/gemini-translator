## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)
-   A Google AI API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azario0/gemini-translator.git
cd gemini-translator
```
*(Replace `gemini-translator` with your actual repository name if it's different.)*

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The application requires your Google AI API key to function.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add your API key to this file as shown below:

    ```ini
    # .env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.

    **IMPORTANT**: The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent you from accidentally committing your secret key to version control.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Flask development server with a single command:

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available in your web browser at:
